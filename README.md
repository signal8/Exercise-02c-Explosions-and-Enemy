# Exercise-02b-Bullets-And-Asteroids

Exercise for MSCH-C220

A user-controlled ship for a space-shooter game. With Asteroids that explode into smaller asteroids, an enemy ship that moves in a sine wave, and a method for player death, as well as a small invincibility window when restarting. Oh, and a small song to test out Unity's XM playback. Note to self, it works, but it doesn't use any loop points you set (at least in FastTracker). Created in Unity.
